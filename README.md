🧠 Steam Phishing Detection Chrome Extension
🔍 Overview

This Chrome extension helps users detect phishing websites impersonating Steam (Valve’s gaming platform).
It analyzes URLs and page context to identify fake login, trading, or inventory pages that attempt to steal credentials or bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA).

When a suspicious site is detected, the extension displays a non-intrusive warning banner prompting the user to double-check the URL before signing in.

⚙️ How It Works

Domain Validation – Compares the current site against an allow-list of official Steam domains (e.g. steampowered.com, steamcommunity.com).

Heuristic Analysis – Flags pages that contain Steam-related keywords (steam, trade, skins, market, etc.) combined with login indicators (login, signin, auth, etc.).

Visual Warning – Injects a banner at the top of the page warning users about potential phishing activity.

Auto-Hide & Dismiss – Banner automatically disappears after 12 seconds or can be manually dismissed.

Educational Link – Provides a link to learn more about Steam phishing attacks and safe login practices.
