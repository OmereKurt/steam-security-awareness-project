# 🛡️ Steam Phishing Detection & Awareness Extension

## 🔍 Overview
This project investigates large-scale phishing campaigns targeting **Steam users**, focusing on fake trading and skin valuation websites designed to steal credentials and bypass **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**. It includes a **Chrome extension** that detects fraudulent Steam login pages through **URL pattern analysis**, **SSL certificate validation**, and **domain heuristics**. The goal is to raise awareness around credential-stealing attacks and help users recognize social engineering and spoofing attempts commonly seen in online gaming ecosystems.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects fake Steam login pages using heuristic detection rules  
- Warns users directly in the browser with a security alert banner  
- Built with **JavaScript** and **Chrome Manifest V3**  
- Includes phishing sample URLs and detection rule datasets for research  
- Promotes awareness and education through real-world phishing examples  

## 🧠 Research Context
This project was developed as part of a cybersecurity awareness initiative exploring:  
- Phishing and credential theft techniques  
- Social engineering in gaming ecosystems  
- Browser-based phishing detection and countermeasures
